        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>Office System International is a family company set up for the sole purpose 
            of wholesale distribution of quality commercial office furniture in Sydney as well as throughout Australia.</p>
        <p>Beside producing and importing products from our melamine and metal works factories based in Xiamen city 
            in Southern China, we also source selected metal products from Taiwan where we have strong business ties and trade connections.</p>
        <p>The furniture industry in Australia has gone through a significant shift so that MOST 
            standardised furniture like the Mobile Pedestals and Standard melamine desks are now imported mainly out of China.</p>
        <p>We at Office System are continuing this trend and further expanding it so that by end of 2022 we hope to have in our range 
            a complete selection of essential office furniture both metal and in melamine finish.</p>
